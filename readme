With rapid socioeconomic development and urbanization, there have been increasing needs to predict traffic congestion and optimize our travel routes. Geotab, a telematics company, has introduced a Kaggle competition to predict congestion based on their data, which consists of aggregated trip logging metrics from commercial vehicles. The data is characterized by spatial and temporal information with transitional behavior and discontinuities. Using this data, we plan to employ Long Short-Term Memory, Support Vector Regression, and Gradient Boosting Tree to predict congestion at major city intersections.
