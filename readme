Training data set Description:
I deleted intersctionId for training, and transform the features('entryheading','exitheading','city) into onehotencoding,
which are the first 19 columns, and I think the last 15 columns are the labels that we need to predict? 
(if that makes any confuse, please take a look at onehotenc.py)
